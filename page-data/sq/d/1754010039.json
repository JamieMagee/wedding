{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"questions":{"title":"Questions?","content":"## Is the wedding going ahead with the coronavirus situation?\n\nYes! We’re just going online! We will be joined by a small group of people for the ceremony at City Hall, and we would love the rest of you to join us online. \n\nCheck your inbox for the full day plan. \n\n## Dress code\n\nThe dress code was originally smart casual (think: no jeans, but also no need for a full suit or a fancy wedding hat!). We’ve heard that some people will still be dressing up just for fun (and we will, at least!). But honestly it’s also fine if you wear pyjamas. Just send us a picture!\n\n## Gifts\n\nWe just want to see your lovely faces on Zoom! Please don't worry about buying a gift.\n\n## How will the online bits work?\n\nWe will use Zoom for both the ceremony live-stream and the reception. Check your inbox for the links.\n\nPlease make sure to join the ceremony live-stream in plenty of time! You should be muted by default during the ceremony. Please make sure to stay on mute to avoid any background noise. \n\nAt the reception, please stay on mute during the speeches. In between speeches, you'll be able to talk and socialise in smaller groups. This will make sense on the day!\n\nYou might want to have a drink nearby for toasts during the reception! (And maybe some snacks to soak up the drink...)\n\n## Playlist\n\nWould you like to add a song to the party playlist? Please email us at [hello@katandjamie2020.com](mailto:hello@katandjamie2020.com) with your suggestion. We'll share the finished playlist with everyone for the day.\n\n## More questions?\n\nWe'll share more details ASAP, but if you also you can email us at [hello@katandjamie2020.com](mailto:hello@katandjamie2020.com)"}}}}}
