    ## Is the wedding going ahead with the coronavirus situation?

    Yes! We’re just going online! We will be joined by a small group of people for the ceremony at City Hall, and we would love the rest of you to join us online.

    A full schedule for the day is coming soon...

    ## Dress code

    The dress code was originally smart casual (think: no jeans, but also no need for a full suit or a fancy wedding hat!). We’ve heard that some people will still be dressing up just for fun (and we will, at least!). But honestly it’s also fine if you wear pyjamas. Just send us a picture!

    ## Gifts

    We just want to see your lovely faces on Zoom! Please don't worry about buying a gift.

    ## How will the online bits work?

    We will use Zoom for both the ceremony live-stream and the reception. We will send round these Zoom links and some more details soon. If you would like to test out your connection before the big day, we are hosting a drop-in session on Saturday 16th from 17:00 to 19:00 UK time. (Nothing exciting happening, but you can just dial in any time that suits you, say hi and get back to your Saturday). Please see your inbox for the trial Zoom link.

    ## More questions?

    We'll share more details ASAP, but if you also you can email us at [hello@katandjamie2020.com](mailto:hello@katandjamie2020.com)
