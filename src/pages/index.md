    ## Dress code


    The dress code is smart casual (think: no jeans, but also no need for a full
    suit or a fancy wedding hat!).


    ## Gifts


    Your presence is present enough! Please don't worry about buying a gift.


    ## Getting around


    **Public transport**


    Copenhagen has a great public transport system that runs 24/7. From the
    airport you can get the Metro, regional train, or bus into the city centre.


    For planning journeys, use
    [Rejseplanen.dk](https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp/index.html?language=en_EN)
    or the
    [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.rejseplanen&hl=en_US)
    or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rejseplanen/id317007942) app. (Heads
    up: Central station is called "Kobenhavn H")


    The nearest metro stop for the ceremony is Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square).
    For the reception it's Kongens Nytorv (which is also where all the metro
    lines connect).


    There are a few different options to buy tickets to get around:


    1. You can buy a ticket from the DSB ticket office or ticket machines

    2. You can download the DOT Mobilbilletter app on
    [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.unwire.projects.dmm)
    or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/dot-mobilbilletter/id494862453)

    3. You can buy a [Rejsekort
    Anonymous](https://www.rejsekort.dk/en/Bestil/Rejsekort-anonymt) from the
    DSB ticket office at the airport (this works like an Oyster card, and makes
    journeys cheaper than a physical or mobile ticket)

    4. You can buy a [Copenhagen Card](https://copenhagencard.com/) if you plan
    on doing some sighseeing while you're here


    For more info, check out VisitCopenhagen's guide ["How to get around in
    Copenhagen"](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/planning/transportation)


    **Taxi**


    Taxis are quite expensive in Denmark, but they are easy to book if you need
    one. The biggest companies are [Taxa](https://www.taxa.dk/en/) or
    [Dantaxi](https://dantaxi4x48.dk/english)


    If you call, speaking English will be fine. Both of these companies also
    have an app that you can book on. (There is no Uber/Lyft etc. in
    Copenhagen.)


    **By foot or bike**


    Copenhagen is quite a small city, so it's still pretty easy to get around by
    foot or by bike. You can hire a bike for an extended period of time from a
    lot of bike shops, or you can get a [Donkey
    Bike](https://www.donkey.bike/cities/bike-rental-copenhagen/) or an electric
    [City Bike](https://bycyklen.dk/en/). If you're feeling brave you can also
    rent a [Lime scooter](https://www.li.me/en-us/home)!


    ## Where to stay


    We have never stayed in a hotel in Copenhagen, so we don't have any personal
    recommendations.


    In terms of location, we think anywhere close to a metro station will be a
    good bet, since it's so quick and runs 24/7.


    The nearest metro stop for the ceremony is Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square).
    For the reception it's Kongens Nytorv (which is also where all the metro
    lines connect).


    ## What time?


    We don't have exact times yet, because we can't book a time for the ceremony
    until four months before the date. We'll let you know as soon as we can.


    We need to be out of the reception venue by midnight. If you'd like to keep
    the party going, we can always go out in the city after that...


    ## Food and drinks


    We'll send out a survey soon for any dietary requirements (vegetarian,
    allergies etc). We have drinks covered for dinner (wine, beer or soft
    drinks).


    After dinner, keg beer is on us :) If you fancy something else, it'll be a
    cash bar.


    ## More questions?


    We'll share more details nearer the date, but if you have a burning question
    you can email us at
