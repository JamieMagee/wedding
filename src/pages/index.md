    ## Dress code


    The dress code is smart casual (think: no jeans, but also no need for a full
    suit or a fancy wedding hat!). Most importantly, we'd like you to be happy
    and comfortable!


    ## Gifts


    Your presence is present enough! Please don't worry about buying a gift.


    ## More questions?


    We'll share more details nearer the date, but if you have a pressing
